INSTALLING ZDOOM

First, get Hermes and install it if you haven't already. You can get it
from http://hermes.terminal.at

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE

Get and install nasm from http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/

Get MIDAS from http://www.s2.org/midas/ and extract it to a src/midas
directory. If you put it somewhere else, edit the Makefile.
The binary distribution alone will work, but if you want to avoid to
long delays in sound playback, get the MIDAS source code as well, and
apply the following patch to midas/src/midas/oss.c:

===========================================================================
59c59
< //static    int numFragments = 0xffff000e;
---
> static    int numFragments = 0x0008000b;
301c301
< #if 0
---
> #if 1
===========================================================================

Once Hermes, nasm, and MIDAS are installed, edit the Makefile as necessary,
then run "make install". Run "make xkeys" as directed. Copy (or create
symbolic links to) your DOOM IWAD files in the share directory.

INSTALLING PRECOMPILED BINARIES

Untar the binary distribution in the root directory. Everything will go
underneath usr/local somewhere.

INSTALLING IWADS

Copy your DOOM IWAD files to /usr/local/share/zdoom. Alternatively, you
can keep the IWADs somewhere else and create symbolic links to them in
/usr/local/share/zdoom. If you aren't using a PC keyboard or XFree86,
and you want to play under X, you might need to download the source and
run "make xkeys" to get ZDoom to recognize your keyboard controls
properly under X.

ZDoom will also look for IWADs in the current directory, ~/.zdoom, and
$DOOMWADDIR.
