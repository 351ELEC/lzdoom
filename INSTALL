INSTALLING ZDOOM
----------------
First, get Hermes and install it if you haven't already. You can get it
from http://hermes.terminal.at

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
----------------------
*Notes about compiling under OSF/1 instead of Linux are at the bottom of
 this file.

Get and install nasm from http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/

Get MIDAS from http://www.s2.org/midas/ and extract it to a src/midas
directory. If you put it somewhere else, edit the Makefile.
The binary distribution alone will work, but if you want to avoid to
long delays in sound playback, get the MIDAS source code as well, and
apply the following patch to midas/src/midas/oss.c:

===========================================================================
59c59
< //static    int numFragments = 0xffff000e;
---
> static    int numFragments = 0x0008000b;
301c301
< #if 0
---
> #if 1
===========================================================================

Once Hermes, nasm, and MIDAS are installed, edit the Makefile as necessary,
then run "make install". Run "make xkeys" as directed. Copy (or create
symbolic links to) your DOOM IWAD files in the share directory.

INSTALLING PRECOMPILED BINARIES
-------------------------------
Untar the binary distribution in the root directory. Everything will go
underneath usr/local somewhere.

INSTALLING IWADS
----------------
Copy your DOOM IWAD files to /usr/local/share/zdoom. Alternatively, you
can keep the IWADs somewhere else and create symbolic links to them in
/usr/local/share/zdoom. If you aren't using a PC keyboard or XFree86,
and you want to play under X, you might need to download the source and
run "make xkeys" to get ZDoom to recognize your keyboard controls
properly under X.

ZDoom will also look for IWADs in the current directory, ~/.zdoom, and
$DOOMWADDIR.

COMPILING UNDER OSF/1
---------------------
If you don't know what OSF/1 is, then you can quit reading now.

To compile under OSF/1, change the Makefile link in this directory to
point to src/osf1/Makefile. Edit the Makefile to reflect your system.
If you don't it will try to install under /home/rheit, which is probably
not what you want. You also need to edit it to find Hermes. I couldn't
get the Hermes library to compile properly under OSF/1, so the OSF/1
Makefile links against the individual Hermes .o files directly. MIDAS
does not work under OSF/1, so there is no sound.

ZDoom was not extensively tested under OSF/1, so use it under that OS
at your own risk. Regulary DOOM levels appear to work okay. Levels with
Hexen features do not. If you want to save your game, you need to set
the cvar nofilecompression to 1, because the LZO compression doesn't
seem to like 64-bit processors. Even then, it might not save properly.
